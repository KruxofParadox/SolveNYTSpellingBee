# New York Times Spelling Bee Solver (NYTSBS)

## Introduction

A few months ago I got into the habit of completing the New York Times Spelling Bee each day. As a side project for myself, I decided to try and code a solution for it that would provide you with valid words given the required letters for the current day's puzzle.

The project is coded exclusively using python, however I plan on fully porting it over into dart to make a companion app out of it.
