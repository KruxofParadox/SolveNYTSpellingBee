# New York Times Spelling Bee Solver (NYTSBS)

## Introduction

A few months ago I got into the habit of completing the New York Times Spelling Bee each day. As a side project for myself, I decided to try and code a solution for it that would provide you with valid words given the required letters for the current day's puzzle.

The project is coded exclusively using python, however I plan on fully porting it over into dart to make a companion app out of it.

## Using the Code

Once you run the program, you will first enter the key letter for the day, that being the one presented in the center of the hexagon on the NYT website. Then, you will enter in the remaining six letters for the day and hit enter. You will then be the 50 most frequently used words that are solutions to the puzzle.
